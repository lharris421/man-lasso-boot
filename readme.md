# Bootstrap for lasso confidence intervals

The focus of this work is on a method for creating confidence intervals for lasso using a bootstrap-based method.

A general overview of other points covered in this paper:

1. Background for the prevailing opinion on bootstrapping for lasso
2. Discussion of two clear and distinct issues with bootstrapping for penalized regression
3. Presentation of method
4. Presentation of the derivation of computational solution/implementation of the method
5. Simulations (general method behavior, addressing 2)
6. Application to real data
