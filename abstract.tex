A New Perspective on Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for LASSO

Chatterjee and Lahiri (2010) showed that even if the lasso itself is root-n consistent, bootstrap confidence intervals are inconsistent, especially when p is large relative to n. Classically, confidence intervals are required to have consistent coverage across all values of the parameter. However, this will inevitably break down for the bootstrap if the underlying estimation procedure is biased. For this reason, many efforts have focused on bootstrapping debiased versions of the lasso. In the process of debiasing, however, the connection to the original model is often obscured. In this work, we offer a different perspective. We derive a methodological fix to avoid the problem of (0, 0) bootstrap intervals and show that with this fix, although bootstrapping lasso estimators does not yield correct coverage in the classical sense for each individual coefficient, it does result in approximately correct average coverage. This perspective also results in confidence intervals that better reflect the original model, as opposed to debiased intervals, which often do not even contain the original lasso estimates.
